I am currently learning to create Data Visualizations and Data Art. My name is Ryan Pedley and I started learning to code in 2021.  I was inspired by a variety of podcasts including The Learn to Code Podcast, HTML All The Things, and The Vanilla JS Podcast. I started my journey into coding with a course in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Within two months of starting the course, I gained the confidence to start my own projects. At this point I could see the pathway for a career in tech.

I have held a variety of positions in different companies. My work experience includes data collection, sales, product management, and mechanical assembly. My goal is to gain the expertise required to transition into a career in data science from a non computer science background.
